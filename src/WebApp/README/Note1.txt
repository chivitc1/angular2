There's currently no way to create migrations programmatically, they must be added via
PowerShell, as we're going to do shortly

Database.EnsureCreated()
Database.EnsureDeleted()
Database.Migrate()

Right after that, open a PowerShell command prompt and navigate through the project's
root folder, which in our example is as follows:
 C:\Projects\OpenGameList\src\OpenGameListWebApp\
Once there, type the following command to add the first migration:
 dotnet ef migrations add "Initial" -o "Data\Migrations"

 dotnet ef database update
